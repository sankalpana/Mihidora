LIRNEaisa conducts in-depth, policy-relevant research at the nexus of economics, technology, and law, using multidisciplinary approaches, and focusing on the following sectors: digital, labour, education, social safety nets, disability, energy, agriculture among others. Within the digital sector, LIRNEasia focuses on a multitude of digital regulation and policy issues, including access, digital rights, misinformation, and data protection. Its work on the information disorder has ranged from a scoping study of the information disorder across the Asia Pacific, to developing local language corpora and machine learning models and AI tools to explore the efficacy of algorithmic detection of misinformation, to understanding the impacts of the information disorder on elections and societies, testing solutions that might help counter it,  to systematically examining the effectiveness of various counter measures including digital literacy programmes.  

Acknowledging the substantial investment in digital technology, LIRNEasia recognises its potential for economic and social progress. However, LIRNEasia emphasises that digital solutions alone are not the answer to improving lives. With a strong focus on inclusion, LIRNEasia works towards dismantling barriers to digital access and use imposed by laws and regulations, aiming for inclusive progress through better knowledge, information, and technology access. Through in-depth research and documentation of regional good practices, the organisation disseminates actionable knowledge to policymakers, regulators, service providers, and the media.
